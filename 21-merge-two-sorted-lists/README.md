## 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

### Problem
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. ([LeetCode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/))

### Approach
This solution iteratively merges two sorted linked lists in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.

**Algorithm:**
- Initialize a dummy node and a tail pointer.
- Traverse both lists, always attaching the smaller node to the merged list.
- When one list is exhausted, attach the remainder of the other list.
- Return the merged list starting from the next of the dummy node.

### Example
List 1: `1 -> 2 -> 4`
List 2: `1 -> 3 -> 4`
Merged list: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4`

### Usage
See `main.go` for code to create linked lists and merge them.
